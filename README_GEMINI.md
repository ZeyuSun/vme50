## üö® Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- **Error**: "API request failed: 403"
- **Solution**: Check that your API key is correct and has proper permissions

### Network Issues
- **Error**: "Failed to fetch"
- **Solution**: Check internet connection; app will fall back to mock data

### Image Upload Issues
